      (synopsis "High-level shading language")
      (description "NVIDIA introduced programmable shading with Cg, which
supported dozens of different OpenGL and DirectX profile targets.  It allowed
developers to incorporate interactive effects within 3D applications and share
them among other Cg applications, across graphics APIs, and most operating
systems as well as balance effect complexities with client GPU capabilities.

The Cg Toolkit is a legacy NVIDIA toolkit no longer under active development
or support.  It is not recommended using it in new development projects
because future hardware features may not be supported.  Going forward, new
development should opt for GLSL rather than Cg.")
