    (description "htmlcxx is a simple non-validating CSS1 and HTML parser for
C++.  Although there are several other HTML parsers available, htmlcxx has some
characteristics that make it unique:
@itemize
@item STL like navigation of DOM tree, using excelent's tree.hh library from
Kasper Peeters
@item It is possible to reproduce exactly, character by character, the original
document from the parse tree
@item Bundled CSS parser
@item Optional parsing of attributes
@item C++ code that looks like C++ (not so true anymore)
@item Offsets of tags/elements in the original document are stored in the nodes
of the DOM tree
@end itemize
The parsing politics of htmlcxx were created trying to mimic Mozilla Firefox
(https://www.mozilla.org) behavior.  So you should expect parse trees similar
to those create by Firefox.  However, differently from Firefox, htmlcxx does
not insert non-existent stuff in your html.  Therefore, serializing the DOM
tree gives exactly the same bytes contained in the original HTML document.")
